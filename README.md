This is a simple python scripts to be installed as a cronjob to upload Iotawatt collected data into ChargeHQ. 
I hesitated a bit whether it would be better to calculate consumption or to pull it as output calculated within Iotawatt. To add battery this calculation has to be amended and either modified in the script (as it is now) or it could be modified in Iotawatt output if it was external.
